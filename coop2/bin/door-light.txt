November 22, 2018 natural daylight == 10h
48 days later we are at 14h

The rules at boot up

Summer
If natural daylight today is greater than 14h
	Open door and turn on light at dawn

Fall
If natural daylight today is less than 14h and more than 10h and decreasing
since yesterday
	Open door and turn on light at dawn

Winter
If natural daylight today is less than 10h
	Search backwards for first date with greater than 10h of daylight
		Set that date as the start date of extra light

Spring
If natural daylight today is less than 14h and more than 10h and increasing
since yesterday
	Search backwards for first date that daylight is decreasing and greater than
	10h of sunlight
		Set that date as the start date of extra light


"""
	If daylight is decreasing find the last date of 10h daylight
		Add 5 minutes per day from that date to extra light up to 14h
	If daylight is increasing find the last date of last year with 10h of daylight
		Add 5 minutes per day from that date up to 14h


If natural daylight is decreasing when 10h is reached start adding 5 minutes per
day extra light in the morning until 14h is reached then hold until natural
daylight is greater than 14h.
